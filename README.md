# 👋 Hello! What's this?

This repository was originally meant to be private—a personal collection of words for my lessons with a teacher. But then I realized I wanted to share my techniques and selected materials with everyone!

I hope this repository helps other English learners like me to pick up the language quickly and effectively. You can use it just for learning new words or as a resource for improving your overall English skills.

The repository is constantly growing and will be updated with new content regularly! 🚀
